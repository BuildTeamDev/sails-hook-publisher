Kue based job publisher(producer) for sails. Its a wrapper around [Kue](https://github.com/learnboost/kue) for publishing jobs by using [redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis) as a queue engine.

*Note: This requires Sails v0.11.0+.  If v0.11.0+ isn't published to NPM yet, you'll need to install it via Github.*

## Installation
```js
$ npm install --save sails-hook-publisher
```

## Usage
In sails hooks, `sails.hooks.publisher` will be available for use and it will expose:

- `queue` : a `kue` based job queue specifially for publish jobs. If you want to consume jobs you may use [sails-hook-subscriber](https://github.com/lykmapipo/sails-hook-subscriber). It is a valid `kue queue` so you can also invoke other `kue` methods from it. [See](https://github.com/LearnBoost/kue#overview)

- `create` or `createJob` : which is a proxy for `kue.create` and `kue.createJob` respectively. See [kue creating jobs for detailed explanations](https://github.com/LearnBoost/kue#creating-jobs) 

## Publishing Jobs
Use `sails.hooks.publisher.create` or `sails.hooks.publisher.createJob` to publish job(s) as way you used with `kue`. You can publish jobs in any place within your sails application where `sails.hooks` is accessible and `sails.hook.publisher` is loaded and available.

Example
```js
//in AuthController.js
//in register(request,response) method

register: function(request,response){
      //your codes ....

      //grab publisher
      var publisher = sails.hooks.publisher;
      
      //publish send confirmation email
      var job = publisher.create('email', {
        title: 'Welcome'
      , to: request.email,
      , template: 'welcome-email'
     })
     .save();
}
```
*Note: The above example demostrate `sails-hook-publisher` usage in controller you can use it in your models and services too*

## Queue Events
`sails-hook-publisher` expose `queue` which is the underlying `kue queue` it use for listening for queue events. For you to listen on your job events on the queue, just add listener on the publisher `queue.on`.

Example:
```js
//somewhere in your codes just once
//prefered on config/bootstrap.js
//or custom hook
//or services
var publisher = sails.hooks.publisher;

//add listener on the queue
publisher
          .queue
          .on('job complete', function(id, deliveryStatus) {
              //your codes here
          });
```
